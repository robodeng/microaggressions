And here is a recent example of why microaggressions lead me to continue to hide who I am.To ""throw shade"" is to belittle someone inadvertently through looks, comments, gestures…Recently at work, I decided to share with a coworker that I am gay. During conversation she made me feel comfortable enough with her to allow her into that part of my life. Although her reaction was with pause (having no idea, she claimed), it was as if our work relationship never changed. Honestly, we're closer now than ever before, which is great. I started to think that with the passage of marriage equality for the LGBT community, there was a different mindset held by the people of this nation. That we LGBT are equal under the law, and that people recognize that.Tolerance, however, is a different story.Within weeks of telling the first coworker that I was gay, it started to come up in conversation. Other people asked, and I wondered how it seemed that everyone had been talking about it.Now a month has gone by, and the relationships with my coworkers have changed. The other day, a coworker told me in front of other coworkers that he doesn't agree with gay marriage. That it's an abomination. That we should have our own ""thing"". That marriage by definition is for a man and a woman, so why should gays be able to marry? It doesn't make sense to him. ""Nothing against you,"" he says. That, right there, belittles me as a human being. It's difficult to work at a place where I am told that I am inferior, but what choice do I have? To walk away and let the bullies continue to win? To contact HR with a case of someone throwing shade?There are certain coworkers who look at me with disgust when no one is around, as if I've committed the most heinous act. Every time I'm walking the floor and pass these certain coworkers, I continue to smile and go on about my way as I see them give me a look that only ""throwing shade"" can describe. I feel as if they are so upset with who I am that I am not even welcome anymore. As if I have offended them by working there and I should not have applied for that job in the first place. I understand that we need to have thicker skin to deal with our problems and that we should hold our head high because we know who we are. But subtly making someone feel inferior is an act of bullying. I am not making myself a victim, the aggressor is. I can understand why the tipping point of racial injustice is turning sideways because the feelings of these ""victims"" (as some would like to put it) are no longer feeling hurt, they are starting to feel upset and angry. All we are doing is trying to stand up for ourselves against a bully. Doing so in one-on-one settings isn't helpful or appropriate. It only further allows the bully to know that they have control over our feelings, and we are tired. Taking this to a national stage and letting the world know they exist is the only way to stop the repeated acts of harassment.Although some argue that teaching about this type of bias will lead to a culture of victims, we are already victims. We have lived with a lifetime of being victimized, and it is nice to finally stand up and call out our aggressors. These aggressors were once called bullies, and people once laughed along with them. Now it seems the people who are upset because we are ""victimizing ourselves"" are the ones who are continuing to bully us today. I thank you for giving us the ability to speak up and not feel ashamed. These slight aggressions make it more difficult to work and at times even to be in public. I see the looks that people give to more obviously gay people in line at gas stations and convenience stores, and I can only imagine what it must be like for them. That is why I continue to hide my sexuality from others. I am not that strong."

No, what's actually happening is that you are disrupting their patterns and routines and it's frustrating them because they don't know how to divert around it and can actually send them into a panic attack.

Straight friends who were had been dating for a year or less had name tags for their partners, and other homosexual partners were in the same boat as me and my partner–no name tag. Fast forward one year: when RSVPing to this year's party, I make a special request for my wife to receive a name tag and point out the discrimination last year. The person in charge of name tags writes back: ""How could you attack me like this? Please don't turn this into a 'straight-gay' thing. It was just an oversight."""

He makes comments like ""the school would be a lot better if the principal weren't Native"", and ""These kids are so stupid, it must be their genes"".

We whine and complain about how racist it is.  As if the only problem is a few racist administrators who need to be fired. And if we just convince them how great Ethnic Studies is, they'd just give us more money.  But if we were actually to imagine a liberatory educational system would this be it? Professors, do we say, ""Tenure was the most fun thing I've ever done, I wish I could do it again""?  Do students say, ""You know, I love it when I work really hard for my finals and then get a bad grade anyway, how empowering was that""?  We don't even try to imagine building an alternative to the Academic Industrial Complex.  We act as if the problem is that there is racism in the academy, not that the academy is structured by racism. And here's where we can learn from the Prison Industrial Complex.  Is not that the organizing against the Prison Industrial Complex puts forth a model of abolition that doesn't just say that it's about tearing down prison walls now but it's about building alternatives that squeeze out the current system. Similarly, while we might have day jobs in the academic system, why can't we start building alternatives to this system, build the educational system that we would actually like to see that could then squeeze out the current system as it develops. So, for instance, when Arizona says something like they're going to ban Ethnic Studies, we think, ""Oh no, there's not going to be Ethnic Studies because the State says so!"" We presume the state owns Ethnic Studies and it actually can ban it.  We don't say, ""Uh, whatever, Arizona! Ethnic Studies is not a gift from the Academic Industrial Complex or from the state.  It's a product of social movements for social justice, and as long as they exist there will be Ethnic Studies wherever and whenever we go.""

						A question we received:Can I (a white, non-Muslim person) submit a microaggression relating to the Islamophobia that is present at my predominantly white, Catholic/Protestant school?The response off the tops of our heads…This is a great and really thoughtful question. While we are not any ""authority"" about microaggressions, for our blog and from what we've read, it would not be posted as a microaggression. The idea is that microaggressions are extremely frustrating, violating little walls that people face in their everyday lives due to one or multiple identities they have.  The original idea for the project was to document this visually so that when for example person of color is explaining to a white person who does not share the ""oppressed"" identity, they could show this website and see a whole conglomeration of these commonplace, daily slights they have to face. While you clearly are conscious and recognize the Islamophobic microaggression, the project is about providing a voice for people who have to experience it. That being said, often times our submissions do not include all of the context or clarify the identity of the submitter, so we don't know - but we'll usually give it the benefit of the doubt & post it if it resonates with us. lastly, I would love for this to be a wider discussion for the microaggressions community - this is a question we get very often.What do you think?
